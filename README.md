# K-Fold-Cross-Validation
A repository for implementing and exploring k-fold cross validation, a popular technique for evaluating machine learning models. 

**K-Fold Cross Validation Implementatio**n

This repository includes a Python implementation of k-fold cross validation using Scikit-learn. 
The implementation includes:

- A function for splitting data into training and testing sets using k-fold cross validation
- A function for evaluating a model using k-fold cross validation

**Examples**

This repository includes examples of using k-fold cross validation for:
- Evaluating the performance of a machine learning model
- Tuning hyperparameters for a machine learning model

**Visualization**

This repository includes code for visualizing the results of k-fold cross validation, including:
- Plotting the accuracy of a model across different folds
- Plotting the confusion matrix for a model
